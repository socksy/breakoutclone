\chapter{Introduction}
\section{A little background}

\paragraph{}The game "Breakout" originated from the ancient age of arcade games, a time in which people would aimlessly fiddle with a mechanical stick in order to produce different series of lights from a box within a cabinet. It was commissioned by Atari, as a single player alternative to the popular multiplayer game "Pong", to a certain man who would later be known to be one of the most influential men in the computing and tech industry; and of which he was first recognised to have demonstrated his excellent power at exploiting other people.

\paragraph{}Breakout consists of a wall of bricks, of which a ball is hit against. By hitting the ball against the wall, the bricks would gradually be eroded, allowing for the ball to "breakout". The player manages to rack up points by destroying as many bricks as possible, all the while preventing the ball to hit the floor, by using their bat.

\section{Task}
\paragraph{}The aim of this was to write a clone of the game in Java, and possibly improve upon it. A working game sshould be produced in the style of Breakout or later, more advanced clones such as Arkanoid which introduced exciting new extras such as powerups and advanced level design.

\chapter{Specification}
\paragraph{}The specification attempted includes the following:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Bricks, Paddle and ball making up the well known basics of the game
\item A scoring mechanism of one's own devising
\item Change in paddle size
\item Changes in ball speed
\item Changes in ball angle, depending on where it hits the paddle
\item Extra levels with different arrangements of bricks
\item Powerups modifying behaviour

\end{enumerate}
