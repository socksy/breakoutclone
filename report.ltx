\chapter{Introduction}
\section{A little background}

\paragraph{}Breakout is one of the greats. One of the oldest. The epitome of all that was gaming greatness, never to have been since matched. Carmack cries at night, hoping for a hit that might, one day, be worthy of gracing the same platitude. Until that day, we are left with shitty clones, like this one.

\section{Task}
\paragraph{}The aim of this was to write a clone of such a game. In java. Motherfucker.
